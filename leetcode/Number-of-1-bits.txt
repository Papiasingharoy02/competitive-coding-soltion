191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer 
and returns the number of '1' bits it has 
(also known as the Hamming weight).



class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count=0;
        while(n!=0){
            
//             check last bit
            if(n & 1){
                count++;
            }
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
